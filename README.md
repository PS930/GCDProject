# GCDProject
This repo contains a script for analyzing data from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S phones tied to individuals participating in a study. Measurments were obtained with various physical activities, such as walking and lying down. 

Please refer to the codebook for a description on how the data was manipulated. The run_analysis.R script contains the code for manipulating the data and for producing on output in the form of a txt file with means and standard deviations of measurements.

This is a project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

Enjoy!
