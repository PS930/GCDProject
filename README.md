This repo contains a script for analyzing data from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S phones tied to individuals participating in a study. Measurments were obtained from various physical activities, such as walking and lying down. For more details on the study, visit: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

Please refer to the codebook for a description on how the data was manipulated. The run_analysis.R script contains the code for manipulating the data and for producing on output in the form of a txt file with means and standard deviations of measurements.

This is a project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.
